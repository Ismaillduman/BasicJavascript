# **JAVASCRIPT**



## _In JavaScript I can defined 3 typeof variables._
---
1.	var
2.	let
3.	const


I can learn “a” is what kind of variable with this method. console.log(typeof(a));
```javascript
let a =4
console.log(a);
console.log(typeof(a));
```



Also wird alles in JavaScript üblicherweise als Zahlendatentyp behandelt.

```javascript
let c = "IsmailDuman"   //string
console.log(typeof(c));
let required = true     //boolean
console.log(typeof(required));

console.log(!required)
to reverse the variable Boolean true—false false—true. (!)
```


## `Differences between the variables`
1.	we can not redeclare with led keyword but that’s possible with var keyword
2.	But we can reassigned with let. Exmp: let c= “Ismail” c= 12
3.	You can not reassigned const variable. That can be understandable from the name constant
4.	When I want to not change a variable so that I have to create const variable. But I want to reassigned later, I have to create let variables. But I want to both reassign and redeclare var variables
